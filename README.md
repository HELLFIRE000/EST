Estrax is a prototype batch tool
Estrax uses ip and port against other items in the ip (internet protocal) to exploit it and in return can crack most ip it includes
ddos, dos, ip lookup, x/twitter info, and more.
this tool is to not be taken lightly as it might look innocent and weak because of it not taking up much storage space but
it is a powerful lightweight tool that is up to daily standards of most pen-testers and coders this tool works wonders
